# pycode phpBB 3.2.5 theme

Minimalistic Dark Theme, based on prosilver and made for personal needs. Now sharing it with the community.

## DEMO

You can try a live demo on the official phpBB style database here: https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/style/pycode/demo/3.2

## Features

- Fully rewritten dark color scheme, with animated transitions for buttons and input boxes.
- Custom made forum and topic icons, for enhancing the overall feeling of the theme.
- Font Awesome and Glyph Icons glyphs.
- "Online" icon has been replaced with CSS3 ribbon that is shown next to username.

Adjust user groups color to your needs, as default ones don't look too good on dark background.
